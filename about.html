                    My name is Iddrisu Sumaila, hailing from Tamale in the northern part of Ghana. I embarked on my educational journey in 2007 and successfully completed my senior high education in 2019. Despite the challenges I faced, I was fortunate to receive sponsorship from a remarkable woman.

                    My path to education was far from effortless; I was advised to pursue computer network management. However, what truly distinguishes my journey isn't merely the obstacles I've overcome; it's the unique path I'm forging independently. While financial support is absent from my equation, unwavering determination fills the void, resonating like an unyielding echo. In a world where resources often smoothen the path, I find myself navigating uncharted waters with my personal compass. Through this, I've realized that self-reliance stands as my most steadfast ally, and each stride forward attests to my resolute commitment.
